## Introduction

*Phenology* is the study of periodic or cyclic natural phenomena, 
and this dataset contains observations of the seasonal cycles of plants at three NEON sites in the US:
Blandy Experimental Farm ([BLAN](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/BLAN)) 
and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute
([SCBI](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/scbi)) in Virginia, and the 
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center
([SERC](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/serc)) in Maryland. 

In this tutorial, we'll plot some phenology data and fit an oscillatory model 
to determine when different species get and lose their leaves. 

## Load and organize data

### Clean up and merge the two data frames

The first part of this tutorial is based on a data cleanup from
https://www.neonscience.org/neon-plant-pheno-data-r. There are two data files 
we'll be combining: the first (`phe_perindividual.csv`) contains data for 
each individual organism observed such as its location and scientific name, 
and the second (`phe_statusintensity.csv`) contains observations of several 
phenophases and their intensity.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# load the two data files 
ind <- read_csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_perindividual.csv')

status <- read_csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_statusintensity.csv')

temp <- read_csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/temp/SAAT_30min.csv') # 30 minute averages of 1Hz observations of air temperature

names(ind)

names(status)
```


We'll remove the UID field which uniquely identifies each row -- we don't 
need to uniquely identify entries.

```{r}
ind <- select(ind, -uid)
status <- select(status, -uid)
```

Next, we remove duplicates that result from stacking tables over many months 
-- we don't need duplicate observations from the same date, tree, and site.

```{r}
ind_noD <- distinct(ind)
nrow(ind) - nrow(ind_noD) # how many rows were removed
```

```{r}
status_noD <- distinct(status)
nrow(status) - nrow(status_noD) # how many rows were removed
```

Some of the columns in `status_noD` that have the same name as those in `ind_noD` 
should be renamed so that we can join the two tables and keep those fields separate. 

```{r}
# where is there an intersection of names?
sameName <- intersect(names(status_noD), names(ind_noD))
sameName

# rename status editedDate
status_noD <- rename(status_noD, editedDateStat = editedDate, 
        measuredByStat = measuredBy, recordedByStat = recordedBy, 
        samplingProtocolVersionStat = samplingProtocolVersion, 
        remarksStat = remarks, dataQFStat = dataQF)
```

```{r}
# convert column to date class
ind_noD$editedDate <- as.Date(ind_noD$editedDate)
str(ind_noD$editedDate)

status_noD$date <- as.Date(status_noD$date)
str(status_noD$date)
```

```{r}
# retain only the max of the date for each individualID
ind_last <- ind_noD %>%
    group_by(individualID) %>%
    filter(editedDate == max(editedDate))

# oh wait, duplicate dates, retain only one
ind_lastnoD <- ind_last %>%
    group_by(editedDate, individualID) %>%
    filter(row_number() == 1)
```

Remove these two columns that will be duplicated in the `ind_noD` data frame.

```{r}
status_noD <- select(status_noD, -taxonID, -scientificName)
```

Join the dataframes:

```{r}
# Create a new dataframe "phe_ind" with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind <- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)

glimpse(phe_ind)
```

### Dealing with NAs

Some columns look like they might only have NAs. We can check the proportion 
of NAs by first summing the number of NA values per column with `map_df()` 
from the `purrr` package, followed by standard `dplyr`/`tidyr` operations to 
reshape the data frame. 

```{r}
# Some columns look like they might only have NAs. Check this:
phe_ind %>% 
  map_df(~ sum(is.na(.))) %>% # counts NA values in each column
  gather(column, values) %>% # reshapes data frame
  mutate(proportion_na = values / nrow(phe_ind)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) # arrange in descending order of proportion_na
```

Now that we've identified which columns are only NA, let's remove them 
from our dataset. `dplyr` offers a helpful function called `select_if()` 
that allows us to only keep columns satisfying a certain condition. 

```{r}
# first, define a function that checks whether not all elements are NA
not_all_na <- function(x) {
  return(!all(is.na(x))) # if all of the vector is just NA, return FALSE
}

# select_if is a version of select that allows us to drop all-NA columns using the above function
phe_ind <- phe_ind %>% 
  select_if(not_all_na)

glimpse(phe_ind)
```

### Subsetting the dataset
 
Let's look at just the "Leaves" phenophase for "Deciduous broadleaf" plants.

```{r}
plant_pheno <- phe_ind %>% 
  filter(phenophaseName == "Leaves" & growthForm == "Deciduous broadleaf")
```

Many of the columns aren't that relevant for us, but some that we're 
definitely interested in are `date`, `phenophaseIntensity`, and `scientificName`. 
Let's take a look at what kind of factors we have in the last two columns.

```{r}
plant_pheno %>% 
  count(scientificName)

plant_pheno %>% 
  count(phenophaseIntensity)
```

These are 7 species of tree / shrub in this subsetted dataset. Feel free to 
look up what the common names are for each of these; for example, 
*Liriodendron tulipifera*, the tulip tree, can be found along the US east 
coast as well as in Southern Ontario.

![Lipidoptera tulipifera, by Jean-Pol GRANDMONT - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9873223](image/Liriodendron_tulipifera.png)

We're going to look at how the phenophase intensity for "Leaves" changes over 
the course of time. Let's look at the structure of the `phenophaseIntensity` column:

```{r}
str(plant_pheno$phenophaseIntensity)
```

We want to be able to use these as numbers, and since they're binned in windows 
of percentage, we can manually convert the bin label to the numeric midpoint of 
the bin. This is approximate, and there are multiple valid choices you could make 
for how to assign a number to each bin. To do this, we'll make use of the 
`case_when()` function, which allows us to `mutate()` on multiple conditions.

```{r}
# convert phenophase intensities to numbers for plotting

# create new column called phenophaseIntensityMidpoint 
# and fill it with the numeric bin midpoint
plant_pheno <- plant_pheno %>% 
  mutate(
    phenophaseIntensityMidpoint = case_when(
      phenophaseIntensity == "< 5%" ~ 0.05 / 2,
      phenophaseIntensity == "5-24%" ~ (0.05 + 0.24) / 2,
      phenophaseIntensity == "25-49%" ~ (0.20 + 0.49) / 2,
      phenophaseIntensity == "50-74%" ~ (0.5 + 0.74) / 2,
      phenophaseIntensity == "75-94%" ~ (0.85 + 0.94) / 2,
      phenophaseIntensity == ">= 95%" ~ (1 + 0.95) / 2
    )
  )

# convert to numeric type explicitly
plant_pheno$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint <- as.numeric(plant_pheno$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint)

# check the structure of the new column
str(plant_pheno$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint)
```

The last processing step is to make sure that the `date` column is a `Date` object.

```{r}
# convert the date column to a date
plant_pheno$date <- as.Date(plant_pheno$date)
```

## Plotting and fitting the data

Let's plot the phenophase intensity over time, grouped by the species.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(plant_pheno, aes(x = date, y = phenophaseIntensityMidpoint, color = scientificName)) +
  geom_point() 
```

The pattern we would expect is already visible in this first plot - the leaves come out in the spring, 
then disappear again in October. But there might be differences between species and between individuals 
in a species. One way we could try to assess this is to fit the same model to subgroups of the data and
then compare the fitted parameters to see if there are differences. 

### Degree Days


Get the max and min temperatures to calculate Growing Degree Days using the Average Method.
```{r}
temp$date <- as.Date(temp$startDateTime)

temp$tempSingleMean <- as.numeric(temp$tempSingleMean)
```

```{r}
head(temp)
```


```{r}
temp_max_min <- temp %>% 
  filter(!is.na(tempSingleMean)) %>% 
  group_by(date, siteID) %>% 
  summarize(max = max(tempSingleMean), min = min(tempSingleMean))

head(temp_max_min)


```

```{r}
# calculate Growing Degree Days
baseline_temp <- 10 # degrees Celsius



temp_max_min$GDD <- (temp_max_min$max + temp_max_min$min) / 2 - baseline_temp # calculate GDD

# cutoff GDD at 0: negative values are assumed to be 0.
temp_max_min <- temp_max_min %>%  mutate(
    GDD = case_when(
      GDD < 0 ~ 0,
      GDD >= 0 ~ GDD))


```

```{r}
temp_max_min$year <- format(temp_max_min$date, "%Y") # make a new column with the year

# calculate cumulative GDD for each site and year separately
temp_max_min <- temp_max_min %>% 
  group_by(siteID, year) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  mutate(GDD_cumulative = cumsum(GDD))

```


```{r}

# where is there an intersection of names?
sameName <- intersect(names(temp_max_min), names(plant_pheno))
sameName

temp_max_min_2016 <- filter(temp_max_min, year == 2016)

plant_pheno_temp <- left_join(temp_max_min_2016, plant_pheno)

head(plant_pheno_temp)
```


```{r}
ggplot(plant_pheno_temp, aes(x = GDD_cumulative, y = phenophaseIntensityMidpoint, color = scientificName)) +
  geom_point() 
```

### Fit an oscillatory model - GDD

CAUTION: ADJUST PERIOD - PERHAPS SHOULD BE FITTING PERIOD INSTEAD?

```{r}
# Make a range of b parameter values to try
b_vals <- seq(1, 6, by = 0.015)

# create a function that does least squares for this model
least_squares <- function(df, b_vals) {
  resids_sq <- sapply(b_vals, function(b) {
    prediction <- 0.5*sin(2*pi/365*df$GDD_cumulative + b) +0.5
    residuals <- prediction - df$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint
    sum(residuals^2)
    })
  return(data.frame(b_vals, resids_sq))
}

# create a data frame that contains the residuals grouped by species
resids_sq_individuals <- plant_pheno_temp %>%
  group_by(individualID, scientificName) %>% 
  do(data.frame(val=least_squares(., b_vals)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(resids_sq_individuals, aes(x=val.b_vals, y = val.resids_sq, colour = scientificName)) +
  geom_point()
```
Get the best fit $b$ value for each individual:

```{r}
resids_sq_individuals <- filter(resids_sq_individuals, !is.na(val.resids_sq))
```


```{r}
# store the best fit values in a new data frame
b_df_all <- resids_sq_individuals %>% 
  group_by(individualID, scientificName) %>% 
  summarize(phase = b_vals[which(val.resids_sq== min(val.resids_sq))])

head(b_df_all)
```

We have best fit values for the phase for every individual plant in our dataset.
To visualize this, we will make a violin plot of the phases, grouped by species.

```{r}
# violin plot
ggplot(b_df_all, aes(x = scientificName, y = phase, colour = scientificName)) +
  geom_violin(scale = 'count', draw_quantiles = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.1) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```


### Fit an oscillatory model to the data

Let's try to fit a sine wave to the phenophase intensity. A generic sine wave has four parameters:

$$y = A \text{sin}(kx - b) + c$$
where $k = 2\pi / T$, $T$ is the period or length of time between peaks, 
$A$ is the amplitude, $b$ is the phase, and $c$ is the vertical shift or offset. 

Let's plot a sine wave:

```{r}
# plot a sine wave
x <- seq(0, 3, 0.01)
A <- 1
k <- 2*pi
b <- 0.5
c <- 0

qplot(x, A*sin(k*x-b)+c) +
  geom_line()
```

In order to use the date as a numeric x-axis for fitting purposes, 
we need to convert it from a `date` object to a numeric object. 

```{r}
# check the structure of the date column
str(plant_pheno$date)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# create a list of all the dates in ascending order
dates = plant_pheno %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  select(date)

# create a function to subtract two dates
subtract_dates <- function(date1, date2) {
  result <- date1 - date2
}

# create a numeric dates list to use in fitting
dates_numeric <- mapply(subtract_dates,
                 dates$date, # first argument in subtract_dates function 
                 dates$date[1]) # second argument in subtract_dates function - the first date

# add numeric dates to the dataframe
plant_pheno$date_numeric <- mapply(subtract_dates, 
                                                plant_pheno$date,
                                                dates$date[1]) # subtract the first date
```

```{r}
# drop rows that have NA in phenophaseIntensityMidpoint column
plant_pheno <- 
  plant_pheno[!is.na(plant_pheno$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint),]
```

Let's fit a particular individual's phenophase intensity.

```{r}
# find an individual
plant_pheno %>% 
  filter(scientificName == "Liriodendron tulipifera L.") %>% 
  select(scientificName, individualID) %>% 
  head(1)

# make a data frame with one individual
tulip_tree <- plant_pheno %>% 
  filter(individualID == "NEON.PLA.D02.SCBI.06071")
```

Now we will create a test sine function to get a rough idea for the 
parameters.

```{r}
# period = 365 days
# wavenumber of sine function = 2 * pi/period 

sine_model <- function(x, amplitude, period, phase, offset) {
  return(amplitude*sin(2*pi/period*x + phase) + offset)
}
A <- 0.5 # phenophase intensity values go between 0 and 1
offset <- 0.5 # add 0.5 to make min 0 and max 1
period <- 365 # number of days in a year
phase <- 0.5 # this is a guess

guess_curve <- sine_model(dates_numeric, A, period, phase, offset)
```

```{r}
qplot(x = dates$date, y = guess_curve) + # guess data
  geom_point(data = tulip_tree,  # actual data
       aes(x = date, y = phenophaseIntensityMidpoint, colour = scientificName)) 
```

We will only fit $b$, the horizontal shift, since we already know the other 
parameters: we know that the minimum and maximum must be 0 and 1 since the 
intensity goes from 0 to 100%, and this sets both $c$ and $A$.
We also know $k$, since we know that the oscillation should go around once in a year (365 days).
If we were being more fancy, we might want to take into account things like temperature and leap years;
there is a `pheno` package in R specifically for plotting and analyzing phenological data.

```{r}
# Make a range of b parameter values to try
b_vals <- seq(0.2, 0.8, by = 0.01)

# use the function 'sapply' to loop over b_vals list
resids_sq <- sapply(b_vals, function(b) {
    prediction <- 0.5*sin(2*pi/365*tulip_tree$date_numeric + b) +0.5
    residuals <- prediction - tulip_tree$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint
    sum(residuals^2)
})
```

As before, plotting the sum of the residuals squards vs. the fit parameter 
will show us if it worked: the best fit is the minimum of the curve.

```{r}
qplot(b_vals, resids_sq)
```

We can see visually that the minimum is around $b = 0.5$, but to extract that number 
from the list we can use the function `which` as before:

```{r}
best_fit <- which(resids_sq == min(resids_sq))
b_fit <- b_vals[best_fit] 
b_fit
```

Finally, let's plot the fit against the original data:

```{r}
ggplot(data = tulip_tree, aes(x = date, y = phenophaseIntensityMidpoint)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = 0.5*sin(2*pi/365*tulip_tree$date_numeric + b_fit) +0.5, colour = 'red'))
```

Not bad! Next, we'll do this for every single individual in the entire dataset. 
With fits for each individual, we can look at the distribution of the phase shifts
for each species to get a sense of when each species gets its leaves.

### Fit each individual separately

```{r}
# Make a range of b parameter values to try
b_vals <- seq(0, 1.1, by = 0.015)

# create a function that does least squares for this model
least_squares <- function(df, b_vals) {
  resids_sq <- sapply(b_vals, function(b) {
    prediction <- 0.5*sin(2*pi/365*df$date_numeric + b) +0.5
    residuals <- prediction - df$phenophaseIntensityMidpoint
    sum(residuals^2)
    })
  return(data.frame(b_vals, resids_sq))
}

# create a data frame that contains the residuals grouped by species
resids_sq_individuals <- plant_pheno %>%
  group_by(individualID, scientificName) %>% 
  do(data.frame(val=least_squares(., b_vals)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(resids_sq_individuals, aes(x=val.b_vals, y = val.resids_sq, colour = scientificName)) +
  geom_point()
```
Get the best fit $b$ value for each individual:

```{r}
# store the best fit values in a new data frame
b_df_all <- resids_sq_individuals %>% 
  group_by(individualID, scientificName) %>% 
  summarize(phase = b_vals[which(val.resids_sq== min(val.resids_sq))])

head(b_df_all)
```

We have best fit values for the phase for every individual plant in our dataset.
To visualize this, we will make a violin plot of the phases, grouped by species.

```{r}
# violin plot
ggplot(b_df_all, aes(x = scientificName, y = phase, colour = scientificName)) +
  geom_violin(scale = 'count', draw_quantiles = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.1) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

The phase $b$ is a positive number for each of these, and in our model we fit the curve
like this:

$$y = A\text{sin}(kx + b) + c$$
A positive $b$ shifts the curve to the left, so our model suggests that species with larger 
$b$ either get their leaves earlier, lose their leaves earlier, or peak earlier, or some 
combination of all three. I'm not a phenologist,
but we can do some reading to see if the general pattern we observe is really there:
*Lonicera maackii*, Amur honeysuckle (an invasive species), does in fact leaf out very 
early in the spring and keeps its leaves longer than other plants, 
according to [this paper](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3159/08-RA-109.1)
by McEwan et al. (2009).

This actually suggests a limitation to our approach: by fitting the same period of sine 
curve to each dataset, we have no information on how long the leaf season is for each 
plant: we have no way of distinguishing a plant that leafs earlier and loses its leaves 
earlier from a plant that peaks earlier and keeps its leaves longer.
It's hard to interpret what $b$ actually means in terms of the phenophase. Let's plot
the smallest and largest $b$ species together:

```{r}
plant_pheno %>% 
  filter(taxonID == "LOMA6" | taxonID == "JUNI") %>% # easier than typing the full scientific name
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y = phenophaseIntensityMidpoint, colour = scientificName)) +
  geom_point()
```

By examining these two species side by side, we can see that *Lonicera maackii*
peaks at about the same time as *Juglans nigra*, but it gets leaves earlier 
and keeps its leaves later. To actually distinguish each of these events, 
we would need a more complicated model with more fit parameters.
